tl;dr:
```clojure
(< slides website)
```

Slides make no one happy. Authors struggle to add content without making them [slideuments](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2006/04/slideuments_and.html). Listeners read them at a different pace than speakers speak them. Both abandon them after the applause dies down.

A website is relatively free of space and time constraints. It can be dynamic. It can be a useful artifact of the presentation.

So:

[Website as deployed](http://genmc.herokuapp.com/)

[Website as constructed](https://github.com/foogoof/genmc)

RSS coming soon :-)

P.S.: Bonus for reading this far: the front page has two fun, subtle things to find.
