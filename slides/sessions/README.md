## What's This?

This folder collects slides from the [Strange Loop](http://thestrangeloop.com) 2013 sessions.

If you try to download slides and see a "Blob too big" error, then the file is too large for GitHub to serve through it's web API. In that case, you should clone the repo:

```git clone https://github.com/strangeloop/StrangeLoop2013.git```
